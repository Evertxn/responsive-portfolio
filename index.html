      <img src="assets/images/me.jpeg" alt="Me" id="bio-image">
      <p> Hello, my name is Everton Webb and I am 22 years old. I have many hobbies and interest, but my favorite is the very idea of creating. I always had a thing for computers and the internet on how they work. Ever since I was young I always tinkered with programs and video games. After deciding that I wanted to get a deeper understanding of the programming world to make my own creations, I signed up for a coding bootcamp and began my journey. </p>

      <p>I like to push myself creatively and mentally to progress myself and my peers to achieve new heights! I'm excited to build new projects from scratch. I love the fact of creating something, from nothing. My goal is to create things in the technology world that will influence the world in many ways. I want to help people, and solve problems that we didn't even know existed. I want to fill the gaps between technology and reality!</p>
